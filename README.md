# homelab-html
This is a project to host a React webpage. The webpage's purpose will be to collect data from page visitors, such as:

<ul>
<li>Time spent on a page</li>
<li>Button clicks</li>
<li>Time between clicks</li>
<li>...and more!</li>
</ul>

Right now, it's just stored on the host file system. Future projects will store data such that it is archived for resiliancy (AWS S3, maybe versioned artifact storage), as well as accessible for future applications to use (i.e. database/in-memory ). Right now, it's just stored on the file system.
